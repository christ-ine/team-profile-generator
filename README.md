Teams are a vital part of any project, and hunting down contact information for each of your team members can often be tedious. This app eliminates the cumbersome task of having to individually find your team members emails and website links and gathers them all into one convenient website.

## Installation
    
To install, run "npm install" in the command line after opening the app. To run the app, enter "node app.js"
    
    
## Usage 
    
When the use runs the program, they will be asked a series of questions about a team member they would like to add. When the user is done inputing all of the information for that team member, they will have the option to add another team member, if they select "yes" they will be asked another set of questions about that member. The process will repeat until the user has entered all of their team members. When the user is done, a file will be generated in the output folder of the app containing all the information about the team in a well-formated webpage
